if a=2
and b =1
--a; is equal to 1
--a - --b;a will be 0 and b will be 0 0-0 is equal to 0
--a - --b+ ++b; a is equal to -1 and b is equal to -1 -1--1 is equal to -2 ++b is equal to 0 ans is -2
--a - --b + ++b +b--; a is -2 and b is -1 is will be -3 and ++b is equal to 0 and b-- is post increment ans is-3
